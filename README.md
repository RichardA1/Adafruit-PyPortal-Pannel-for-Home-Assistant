# Adafruit-PyPortal-Pannel-for-Home-Assistant
Make your very own control panel and sensor node that uses MQTT to interface with Home Assistant.

When finished, the PyPortal will read the temperature, light level, detect motion, and use virtual buttons to send data via MQTT to Home Assistant so it can be used in Automations. Along with the sensors we will be able to display data from Home Assistant on the PyPortal screen for quick updates.

The guide for making this project will be published shortly and a link to it will be posted here.
